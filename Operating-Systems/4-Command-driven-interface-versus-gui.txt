4) Command driven interface(CLI) versus GUI


-----------------------------------
CLI:
  - lets users use command/written commands that associate directly with the terminal
  - or console windows, which would allow them to interact directly with the OS;

GUI:   
  - lets users use graphics for interacting with the OS;
  - In a GUI we have buttons, windows, scrollbars, pictures, etc;
  - It is very intuitive yet simple to use, even for a newbie;

Difference between CLI and GUI:
  - GUI easier to understand and use;
  - CLI consumes comparatively less memory;
  - CLI works at a higher speed;
  - CLI only requires a user's keyboard;  
  - GUI can change or modify OS appearance;
  - GUI uses graphics;
  - GUI comes with menus;
  - No typing errors or spelling mistakes can be avoided by CLI;
