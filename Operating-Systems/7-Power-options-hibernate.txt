7) Power options e.g. hibernate


-----------------------------------
Power options:
  - we can choose what pressing the power button on the computer should do and configure the monitor;
  - and computer power to be reduced after a specified period of inactivity;  

1) Hibernate:
  - is a mode that saves the current state of the computer and shuts it down;
  - When started again, it restores to the same state, but without consuming power in the meantime;
  
2) Sleep:
  - uses little power;
  - Your computer technically stays on, but all actions on your computer are stopped;
  - any open documents and applications are out in memory;
  - You can quickly resume normal operation within a few seconds;

3) Power Plans:
  - There are three power plans that can be configured and selected depending on the current need:
    - Power Saver;
    - Balanced;
    - High Performance;

4) Standby:
  - is a old version of Sleep mode;

5) Turn on Fast Startup:
  - places the system into hibernation during shutdown so that the system can boot more quickly;
