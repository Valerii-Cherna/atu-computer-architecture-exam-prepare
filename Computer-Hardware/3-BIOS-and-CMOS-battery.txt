3) BIOS and CMOS battery


-----------------------------------
BIOS:
  - is firmware stored in a chip on your computer's motherboard;
  - it is the first program that runs when you turn on your computer;
  - Performs the POST(power-on self-test), which initializes and test your computer's hardware;
  - Provides a simple interface for configuring your computer's hardware;
    
CMOS:
  - When you make changes to your BIOS configuration, the settings are not stored on the BIOS chip itself;
  - Instead, they are stored on a special memory chip, which is called CMOS;
  - It holds a small amount of data, usually 256 bytes;
  - CMOS saves information about:
    - types of disk drives are installed;
    - the current date and time of your system clock;
    - your computer's boot sequence;
