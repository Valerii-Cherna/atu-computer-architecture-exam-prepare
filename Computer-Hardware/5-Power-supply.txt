5) Power supply
  - replacement
  - moving from Europe to the USA
  - UPS
  - Calculating current, voltage, power

-----------------------------------
Power supply:
  - converts AC(alternating current) current to DC(direct current) current;

Replacement:
  - Unplug and open your computer;
  - Disconnect the old power supply;
  - Remove the old power supply;
  - Install the new power supply;
  - Connect the new power supply;
  - Close and test your computer;

Moving from Europe to the USA:
  - check the power supply for multi-voltage;
  - if it is good for 100-250V, 50-60Hz, you have to change only plug adapter;

  USA - 110v
  Europe - 220v 

UPS:
  - An uninterruptible power supply(UPS) is a type of continual power system that provides automated backup electric power;
  - to a load when the input power source or mains power fails;

Basic Units:
  Voltage(V) - measured in volts(V);
  Current(I) - measured in amperes(A);
  Power(P) - measured in watts(W);
  Resistance(R) - measured in ohms(â„¦);

Ohm's Law:
  Voltage(V) = Current(I) * Resistance(R)
  Power(P) = Voltage(V) * Current(I)
  Power(P) = Voltage(V)^2 / Resistance(R)
  Current(I) = Power(P) / Voltage(V)  

Example:
  P = 100W
  V = 9V
  I = P / V = 100 / 9 = 11.11A
