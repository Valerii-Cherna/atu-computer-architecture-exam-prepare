-----------------------------------
Processor:
  
Multicore:
  - has multiple processors within a single package;
  
  Dual Core CPU - 2 CPUs inside a single chip;
  Triple Core CPU - 3 CPUs inside a single chip;
  Quad Core CPU - 4 CPUs inside a single chip;
  Hexa Core CPU - 6 CPUs inside a single chip;
  Octa Core CPU - 8 CPUs inside a single chip;

Hyperthreading:
  - is a feature of some processors that allows a single processor to run threads in parallel;

Multithreading:
  - is a feature of an application that allows it to send multiple threads at the same time;

Throttling:
  - is a process of modifying the operating characteristics of a processor based on current conditions;
  - Used in low memory conditions to slow down the processing of I/O memory requests;
  - Processors or the OS can shut down unused cores in multi-core systems to conserve energy;

Fetch execute cycle:
  - is the basic operation cycle of a computer;

  Store - The newly processed is written back into the memory location on the HDD or SSD
  Fetch - The CPU retrieves instructions from a system hard drive or solid-state drive and stores them in a register location;
  Decode - The CPU determines which system components are required in the execution of the instruction, outlining parameters for a successful execution;
  Execute - The CPU assigns specific actions to the relevant system component in order to carry out the initial program instructions processing the actual data;  

  E-Time: Execute -> Store
  I-Time: Fetch -> Decode
